<h1>Design Principle Methods Team 15 Final Project</h1>

<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    The goal of this project was to build robot using the lego Mindstorms NXT parts and make it accomplish a set of
    tasks, requirements. The flow of the competition is started off by informing our robot of the layout of the arena.
    Using
    the <i>Wifi</i> class, which is provided, the robot will be sent the map. To allow the user to input various
    values. Next, the robot
    must
    localize itself in the arena. For this, it needs to find two sets of variables, orientation and position. The orientation is found with
    the
    help of the <i>FallingEdgeUSLocalization</i> class. Next, the position are filled in using the
    <i>LightLocalization</i> class which fills in the X and Y of the robot in the arena. To allow the robot to keep
    track
    of its position all along the competition our first thread is implemented, an odometer with the <i>Odometer</i>
    class. A thread is dedicated to the odometer as one does not want the odometer to
    lose
    track of the position and orientation due to another method running. To then allow the user to get feedback on
    the
    status of the robot, another thread was used in <i>OdometryDisplay</i> class as we want the screen to be
    constantly
    updated whilst the robot performs other actions.
	These two classes make up the threads implemented in our software.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    Apart from the previously mentioned threads, the class that controls the sequences of actions of the robot is the <i>Controller</i> class.
	This class implements
    the logic of the movement of the robot throughout the map by controlling the remaining classes such as the <i>LightLocalization</i> class,
	the <i>FallingEdgeUSLocalization</i> class, the <i>ZiplineTraversal</i> class, the <i>RiverTraversal</i> class, and the <i>BlockDetection</i> class.
	The reason behind implementing a separate class that handles all the control of the robot's movements instead of doing it in <i>CaptureMainFlag</i>
	itself was because we wanted the <i>CaptureFlagMain</i> thread to simply instantiate variables and start the other threads.
	Besides this, the <i>Navigation</i> class is one that takes care of moving
    the robot across various environments, whether it be a gridded floor, a zipline, or an imaginary river in the
    middle
    of the map. When the terrain happens to be a zipline, or a river, the classes <i>ZiplineTraversal</i>, and
    <i>RiverTraversal</i> are respectively called aid the navigation. These classes therefore help the robot cross
    from
    one side of the map to the other. The class, <i>BlockDetection</i>, then helps with finding blocks and
    identifying which of them is the opponents flag. Once the flag has been captured, the robot must return to its side with
    the help of the <i>Navigation</i> class once again.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    The last part of the structure of this project are the interfaces: <i>LightController</i> and
    <i>UltrasonicController</i>. These interfaces are the basic methods that are needed to get the data from the
    sensors. Therefore, various classes implement them and possibly override their methods to tailor the
    interpretation of the data according to their needs.

	Below explains the usage of the shared variable amongst the threads followed by a diagram showing their communication. <br> <br>
	<b> Odometer's position: </b> <br>
	<i> OdometryDisplay Thread</i> needs to talk to the
	<i> Odometer Thread</i> to get its position to display it. <br>
