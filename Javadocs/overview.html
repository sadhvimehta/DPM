<h1>Design Principle Methods Team 15 Final Project</h1>

<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    The goal of this project was to build robot using the lego Mindstorms NXT parts and make it accomplish a set of
    tasks, requirements. The flow of the competition is started off by informing our robot of the layout of the arena.
    Using
    the <i>Wifi</i> class, which is provided, the robot will be sent the map. To allow the user to input various
    values. Next, the robot
    must
    localize itself in the arena. For this, it needs to find two sets of variables, orientation and position. The orientation is found with
    the
    help of the <i>FallingEdgeUSLocalization</i> class. Next, the position are filled in using the
    <i>LightLocalization</i> class which fills in the X and Y of the robot in the arena. To allow the robot to keep
    track
    of its position all along the competition our first thread is implemented, an odometer with the <i>Odometer</i>
    class. A thread is dedicated to the odometer as one does not want the odometer to
    lose
    track of the position and orientation due to another method running. To then allow the user to get feedback on
    the
    status of the robot, another thread was used in <i>OdometryDisplay</i> class as we want the screen to be
    constantly
    updated whilst the robot performs other actions. Next, our third thread is dedicated to the class <i>OdometryCorrection</i>. This class takes care of
    correcting the odometer of the robot as the competition unfolds. Odometry correction occurs through the detection of grid lines drawn on the arena.
    This
    class must absolutely be a thread as we would not want to miss a line capture whilst the robot moves along the tiles.
	These three class make up the threads implemented in our software.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    Apart from the previously mentioned threads, the class that controls the sequences of actions of the robot is the <i>Controller</i> class.
	This class implements
    the logic of the movement of the robot throughout the map by controlling the remaining classes such as the <i>LightLocalization</i> class,
	the <i>FallingEdgeUSLocalization</i> class, the <i>ZiplineTraversal</i> class, the <i>RiverTraversal</i> class, and the <i>BlockDetection</i> class.
	The reason behind implementing a separate class that handles all the control of the robot's movements instead of doing it in <i>CaptureMainFlag</i>
	itself was because we wanted the <i>CaptureFlagMain</i> thread to simply instantiate variables and start the other threads.
	Besides this, the <i>Navigation</i> class is one that takes care of moving
    the robot across various environments, whether it be a gridded floor, a zipline, or an imaginary river in the
    middle
    of the map. When the terrain happens to be a zipline, or a river, the classes <i>ZiplineTraversal</i>, and
    <i>RiverTraversal</i> are respectively called aid the navigation. These classes therefore help the robot cross
    from
    one side of the map to the other. The class, <i>BlockDetection</i>, then helps with finding blocks and
    identifying which of them is the opponents flag. Once the flag has been captured, the robot must return to its side with
    the help of the <i>Navigation</i> class once again. All along, the <i>Controller</i> makes sure that the robot is
    not
    running into anything with the help of <i>ObstacleAvoidance</i> class in case the robot gets too close to any object.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 30px">
    The last part of the structure of this project are the interfaces: <i>LightController</i> and
    <i>UltrasonicController</i>. These interfaces are the basic methods that are needed to get the data from the
    sensors. Therefore, various classes implement them and possibly override their methods to tailor the
    interpretation of the data according to their needs.

	<b> Enumeration of Capture The Flag Threads: </b>
	<ul>
		<li> CaptureFlagMain </li>
		<li> Odometer </li>
		<li> OdometryCorrection </li>
		<li> OdometryDisplay </li>
	</ul>
	
	<b> Enumeration of Capture The Flag Threads' Shared Variables: </b>
	<ul>
		<li> Odometer's Position </li>
		<li> isLocalizing </li>
		<li> lineEncountered </li>
	</ul>
	
	Below explains the usage of the shared variable amongst the threads followed by a diagram showing their communication. <br> <br>
	<b> Odometer's position: </b> <br>
	<i> OdometryDisplay Thread</i> needs to talk to the
	<i> Odometer Thread</i> to get its position to display it. <br>
	<i> OdometryCorrection Thread</i> sets the odometer's position during correction (when a line is encountered). <br> <br>
	<b> lineEncountered & isLocalizing: </b> <br>
	<i> OdometryCorrection Thread</i> is constantly checking if <i>lineEcountered</i> is true AND if <i>isLocalizing</i> is false. Only then will it set the odometer's position. <br> <br>
